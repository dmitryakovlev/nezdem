# Hi there, wonderful stranger!

You've got a job proposition, and look at that, you've stumbled upon my little 
corner of the internet. **What a serendipitous moment, considering I'm all 
geared up for some exciting new adventures!**

Thanks a bunch for thinking of me for this role. Let's dive into this opportunity 
with an open heart, keeping in mind we both have pretty packed schedules. My 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitryakovlev) inbox is like a bustling 
city - always busy, mostly with stuff that's not on my wishlist. So, I figured, 
why not streamline our chat? Before we get into that, let me sketch a little 
picture of myself.

I'm **Dmitriy**, a dab hand at **Web Design** and **Frontend Development**, with a good 
6 years of jazzing up the internet.

Here's where I've left my mark before:

- **Frontend Developer and Lead Designer at [Igluu](https://igluu.cz/)**: Here, I was the 
wizard behind the curtain, making sure everything looked sleek and worked smoothly, ensuring 
folks had a breeze finding their next home.

- **Developer and Lead Designer at [SmarTech IT](https://smartech-it.eu/)**: Teamed up to 
bring an electronic signature service to life, sprinkling it with a bit of innovation magic.

- **Industrial Designer at [Diehl Controls](https://www.diehl.com/controls/en/)**: Got to play 
with designing interfaces for gadgets you use every day â€“ think coffee machines in malls and 
touchy-feely washing machines.

Before you hit 'send' on an email with your job offer, here's the scoop on what makes my world go round:

- I'm at my best when I'm the bridge between the designers and the coders. I love making sure 
everyone's singing from the same song sheet, making the magic happen faster for everyone.

- I'm all about that remote life. If your team is cool with working from where they feel most 
inspired, we're going to get along just fine.

- Tech-wise, I'm a _TypeScript_ enthusiast, with _React.js_ for the flashy front-end stuff, 
and a solid _Node.js + GraphQL_ combo for the behind-the-scenes action. When it comes to 
design, Figma or Sketch are my go-to tools.

- As for the nitty-gritty, my day rate starts at _280 EUR (1200 PLN)_ or, for the long 
haul, _70,000 EUR/year_.

Checked all the boxes and think we could be a match made in professional heaven? If you're 
nodding yes, then do me a favor and drop me an email at [job@nezdem.com](mailto:job@nezdem.com) 
or book a quick call in my [Calendar](https://cal.com/nezdem/).

Cheers,
Dmitriy Yakovlev
