      Hey there! I&apos;m <Text backlight>Dima</Text> - your go-to guy for all
      things web design and frontend development. With a solid 6+ years under my
      belt, I&apos;m all about jazzing up teamwork and smoothing out the convo
      between designers and developers. Why? Because who likes waiting ages for
      projects to finish? Not me, and I&apos;m guessing not you either. My
      mission is simple: cook up innovative solutions and keep that code looking
      sharp and modern. Ready to amp up your projects? Let&apos;s make some
      magic happen together!
